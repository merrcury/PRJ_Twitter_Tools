# PRJ_Twitter_Tools

In this I have designed some twitter tools(more to come). Using this twitter tools you can analyze data available on twitter platform and perform different computations on it. This project is meant only for the educational purpose only, I request you not to use this information in any political campaigns for any kind sentiment analysis which can influence the audience's opinion. This project is built on Python and using several twitter api(s) & libraries. 

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.

At time of developing this program following version of packages/libraries is used.
1. Python version 3.7.1
2. Twitter version 1.18.0 
3. Tweepy version 3.7.0

This is required & correct information upto my knowledge.
